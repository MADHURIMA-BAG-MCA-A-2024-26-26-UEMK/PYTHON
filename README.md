    Write a function dict_length(d) that returns the number of key-value pairs in a given dictionary.
6. Merging Two Dictionaries Given two dictionaries:-
    d1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    d2 = {"b": 3, "c": 4}
    Write a program to merge d1 and d2, where keys in both dictionaries should have the values from d2.
7. Removing an Item from a Dictionary     Given the dictionary:
    country_capitals = {"USA": "Washington", "France": "Paris", "India": "New Delhi"}
    Write a program to remove the key "France" from the dictionary and print the updated dictionary.
8. Converting Two Lists into a Dictionary Given two lists:
    keys = ["name", "age", "city"]
